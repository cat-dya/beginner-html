If you enjoy tinkering with drag-n-drop sites like carrd, rentry, or strawpage but can't justify paying a subscription for more features, it's time to learn HTML!

This project is intended to be beginner-friendly (assuming you have zero experience in coding or HTML). There are notes in the HTML code and this is meant to be easy to copy and paste into your neocities or nekoweb site!

You do not need to install anything, just click on the index.html file and copy everything, then paste it into index.html on your  neocities or nekoweb. 

There will be a companion youtube piece where I go more in-depth about what things are!

**This is NOT intended to be an "intro to webdev" as it is focused on onboarding users of carrd, rentry, and strawpage to make a simple one-page site. You can use the template as-is, make modifications, or (better yet) turn it into a stepping stone into more advanced layouts!**
