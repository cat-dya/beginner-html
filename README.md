If you enjoy tinkering with drag-n-drop sites like carrd or strawpage but can't justify paying a subscription for more features, it's time to learn HTML!

This project is intended to be beginner-friendly (assuming you have zero experience in coding or HTML). [Follow the tutorial on youtube!](https://youtu.be/cEN-SS92qlg?si=Ilaa35vOiQYXDZZ4). 

You do not need to install anything, just click on the index.html file and copy everything, then paste it into index.html on your neocities or nekoweb. Make it your own!

**This is NOT intended to be an "intro to webdev" as it is focused on onboarding users of carrd and strawpage to make a simple one-page site. You can use the template as-is, make modifications, or (better yet) turn it into a stepping stone into more advanced layouts!**
